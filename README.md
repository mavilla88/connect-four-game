Putting everything I've learned so far together to create a fun and interactive game of Connect Four. To do this, I extensively used: DOM Manipulation, advanced array methods, and features of the ES2015 update I just learned about. This project has been designed to incorporate all of the skills I've been developing in this Software Engineering Career Track. A portfolio piece to show off my front-end development skills.
